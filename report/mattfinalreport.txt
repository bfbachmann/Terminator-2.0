Matt wrote data gathering functions and a test bench for hall effect sensors and magnets. 

A standard Arduino library program was used to create a magnetic field detection program. To program the sensors to be slide-by switches, a virtual state machine was used to determine if the magnet was detected or not. This made the data gathering function edge-triggered. 

When the magnet would be attached to the wheel, the program would update speed based on time difference and distance traveled. To configure this initially, a test bench was created for Arduino that could output these parameters on serial monitor.

Problems encountered were mainly spacial constraints, as we ran out of analog input ports on our master Arduino. The hall effect sensors were ultimately not implemented for our final design.
