The reflective optical sensor array has been wired and code has been written
to read from them. We have begun creating the line following function, which
integrates work done on the motor as well as with the optical sensors.

The only issue encountered so far has been excess heat generated by the 
reflective optical sensors, even though max forward current had not been
exceeded. A simple solution was to add slightly more resistance -- but
not too much -- making sure to not significantly reduce variation in
readings from the sensors.

The line following function is to work as follows: using two sensors
in the middle of the array for guidance, the wheels will adjust left or
right whenever the reflectivity senors on the outside detect the
electrical tape, as this signals the car is straying.

Another consideration is to implement the functionality to find the 
line again, should the car lose the line completely. We have not
started on this yet, but it will likely simply involve searching for
a signal from a reflectivity sensor while the car moves along an arc.
