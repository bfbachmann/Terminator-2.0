Wrote code for hall effect sensor based on Arduino Playground example, modifying it to be used as a slide-by switch. Found one hall sensor in our kit and tested it with Arduino. Successfully got slide-by switch method to work. Using sensor as a binary detector of a magnets rather than measuring magnetic field strength, for program efficiency. Also made a prototype method for determining wheel speed using Arduino millis() function.
