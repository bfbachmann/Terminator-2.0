Bruno was responsible for hanlding the distance and temperature sensors for the robot. He wrote the code in the ExtwernalData class for reading from each ultrasonic sensor both inidvidually and all together and adjusting the distance read from the sensors depending on the air temperature at the time. The other piece of software he wrote resides in the Control class and is responsible for setting the servo motor to a specific angle to be used in combination with reads from the mounted ultrasonic sensor for sweep-scanning the environment. He also set up the Fritzing schematic for conencting the distace and temperature sensors and the servo motor to the Arduino. He has began designing the sheet metal mounts for the servo motor and the ultrasonic sensors and will begin building them this weekend.
